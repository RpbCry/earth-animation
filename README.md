# Earth Animation
This is a simple batch script that creates an Earth animation in the command prompt window. When you run the earth_animation.bat script, you will see an animated representation of Earth. The animation is accompanied by a green text color (color code 0A) to enhance the visual effect.

## How to Run the Animation
Ensure you have Windows operating system installed on your computer.
Download the earth_animation.bat file to your preferred directory.
Double-click on the earth_animation.bat file to run it.
A command prompt window will open, and you will start to see the Earth animation.

## How the Animation Works
The animation is created using a simple loop. It repeatedly pings the local host (localhost) with a short delay between each ping. The purpose of the ping command is to introduce a pause in the script execution, thus creating the appearance of an animated Earth.

## Note
The animation will continue to loop indefinitely until you manually close the command prompt window.
This script is intended for entertainment purposes only and does not have any practical use beyond displaying a basic animation.
The script may not work on non-Windows systems as it is specifically designed for the Windows command prompt.
